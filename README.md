# Building an MLOps Project: Phase 1: Planning & Design

## Scope and Define
- Define objectives & goals, target metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency, throughput), target business outcomes
- Identify stakeholders and their roles
- Create a project timeline with milestones

## Data Strategy
- Data Sources: External data sources, internal data sources (batch vs. real-time)
- Data Quality: Define data quality standards (e.g., accuracy, completeness)
- Data Labeling: Plan for cleaning/validation/labeling needs
- Data Governance: Establish governance; outsourced vs. in-house, security, crowd-sourced

## Model Selection & Architecture Design
- Problem Statement: Define problem type (regression, classification, clustering), identify the ML task
- Algorithm Research: Explore potential algorithms and research best one
- Baseline Model Type & Data Characteristics: Create a simple model to establish performance baseline
- Model Architecture Design: Design a modular & scalable architecture if necessary

# Building an MLOps Project: Phase 2: Development & Experimentation

## DataOps: Create
- Data Pipelines Implementation
- Automated cleaning, data ingestion, and features transformation pipelines for structured data
- Data Versioning: Use tools like DVC or Pachyderm to track datasets changes & store data pipelines' feature transformations (Optional)
- Feature Store: Store and manage features to centralize and reuse for different models (Optional)
- Data Exploration and Testing: Use tools like Facets or TensorBoard to explore datasets thoroughly

## ModelOps: Experiment, Tracking & Bias Towards Weight Loss
- Experiment with TFx, MLflow
- Use TensorBoard or Weights & Biases to track model hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts; use tools like MLflow to version models
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Use tools like Keras Tuner or Optuna for performing systematic tuning of model hyperparameters

## Version Control and Collaboration
- Code Reviews: Implement code review best practices for versioning Git integration
- Branches for Quality Assurance Reviewing strategy; adopt a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to effectively manage code changes
- MLOps as Code Testing: Integrate unit tests into your MLOps model build so you do not add any code that does not pass tests. Model performance & experimentation

# Building a MLOps Project: Phase 3: Deployment and Monitoring

## Deployment
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, or Google Cloud AI.
- **Model Serving**: Use tools like KFServing, Seldon Core & BentoML for model serving in web applications.
- **Web/App**: Application code wraps models for edge deployment (e.g., Flask) to enable model interaction.

## Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Monitoring Tools**: Utilize tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and logging platforms.
- **Logging**: Implement logging of model inputs/outputs for performance metrics.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for performance degradation or specific monitoring solutions.

# Building a MLOps Project: Phase 4: Optimization and Governance

## Model Optimization
- **Performance**: Profile the model to identify bottlenecks and optimize for speed and resource usage.
- **Accuracy**: Harness model compression techniques like quantization or pruning to reduce size.
- **Batch Prediction**: Use batch mode processing for efficient inference.

## Security and Governance
- **Model Security**: Implement protection measures to secure the model from unauthorized access and adversarial attacks.
- **Model Bias/Audits**: Regularly audit the model for biases and take corrective measures.

## Documentation
- Create thorough documentation for the project, including data descriptions, deployment architectures, model instructions, and monitoring procedures.

## Feedback Iteration
- Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Continuously monitor performance; iterate, refine based on analysis, and redeploy.
